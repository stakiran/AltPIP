## The limits of Performance Improvement Plans
A Performance Improvement Plan (commonly known as a PIP) effectively functions as a "marked for termination" label. To avoid legal risk, companies merely stage it as "you became eligible for termination through a legitimate process and evaluation." **The essence of a PIP is simply to "fire low performers."** That's all.

At first glance, it may look rational, but there's a pitfall: it assumes a single, narrow definition of "performance." In other words, it lacks diversity.

Specifically, it only assumes performance as a project worker. Now, project work is inherently social: to fit into a team and to be evaluated, teamwork is indispensable. That means it demands communication aptitude and social know-how, as well as the toughness and life circumstances necessary to keep participating in high-load communication opportunities. In effect, only **a certain kind of "excellent talent"** is assumed.

## Alt PIP
Alt PIP is the idea of creating a different role and enabling contribution there, instead of firing low performers based on an overemphasis on project-worker performance.

### What to do
There are three points that must be satisfied.

- Create roles that do not do project work
- Have people fully commit to a specific role and act autonomously. Also, tune the role so that work can be completed individually rather than as a team
- To ensure everyone in the company will engage with it, conduct company-wide education about Alt PIP and each role. Also include measurement processes to enable fair evaluation

### Example: Blogger
For example, a "blogger" is easy to understand.

They take on some theme and persona, and publish blog posts that all employees can read. Writing about one post per day is taken as a given, and they also accept comments and inquiries from all employees. Since it's not a project, it's always best-effort, but in terms of the performance of publishing and interacting, they would likely be far stronger than a typical employee.

### Philosophy
Normally, the blogger role would not be accepted, because they're not a project worker. However, **a low performer may simply be someone who isn't suited to project work in the first place**, so it's better to establish roles outside projects.

That's why it's Alt PIP. By assigning a completely different role unrelated to project-work performance, there's a greater chance that someone's talents will bloom and their opportunities will expand. It will also provide stimulation and learning for the majority of employees who are working hard on project work.

Structurally, the larger the company, the better. A few hundred or a few thousand people might be too small. Tens of thousands is ideal. However, depending on education and evangelism, it can work well even in companies with fewer than a few thousand employees.

## Evaluation method
Instead of direct metrics such as revenue or reduced work-hours, use "volume" quantitatively (e.g., the amount of accumulated information) and qualitatively use feedback from employees who are users/readers.

"We're influencing people broadly and shallowly, so we're probably contributing at least as much as one employee."

This is how we think. We call this **Wide Contribution**. Traditional project work was Deep Contribution confined to that project and its context, but Alt PIP does not handle Deep at all; instead, it handles Wide.

Take the blogger as an example. Suppose in a company of 10,000 employees, they write 120 posts per year and generate 2,000 unique users and 30,000 page views. This is a solid Wide Contribution. A single employee, through blogging alone, attracts the attention of 2,000 people and earns an average of 250 PV per post. Considering the number of unique users, we can assume there are many repeat readers. At least several hundred, and possibly more than 1,000. Even if it's 300, they're continuously making impressions on 300 people. That's something not even your average manager can do.

However, many people won't be convinced because the details aren't visible, so it should be properly measured.

## Main roles
Define Alt PIP roles however you like. Alt PIP is exploratory by nature: you can try creating a role and letting someone do it. Of course, arrangements by the Alt PIP assignee are allowed, and proposals are welcome.

Still, examples make it easier to understand, so here are the main roles. Use these to grasp the nuance of Alt PIP.

### Blogger
A role that updates blog posts frequently for all employees to read.

A rule of thumb is one post per day. In other words, if you work 20 days a month, you'll write 20 posts a month. This is a balance of "not being too perfectionistic" while also "not being too sloppy." Also, daily updates help people recognize a rhythm and make it easier to secure readers.

The requirement for this role is **being able to sustainably continue updating one post per day**. Specifically, the following are required.

- Activity theme
- A persona to present
- Ability to verbalize and write
- Ability to express things clearly for readers, sometimes in a catchy way
- The mental resilience to withstand being read and commented on by all employees

For the theme, it's best to balance two points: proposals from the assignee and proposals from the company. It doesn't need to be limited strictly to work-related themes. For example, if someone is a low performer but their hobby is live streaming and they're knowledgeable about it, they could become a blogger on streaming topics. Streaming techniques and know-how should be reasonably useful to all employees, and this blogger will almost certainly bring value equivalent to more than one employee.

Communication with employees is limited to comments on posts and direct messages such as email or chat. If the person wants, you may provide other means, but their core work is, strictly speaking, updating posts for all employees and interacting around them. It must be open.

### Gigger
"Gigger" is formed by adding "-er" to "gig" in gig worker. Here it refers to an internal gig worker: a role that takes on small tasks (called gigs) that can be completed within a single sprint.

The sprint unit will depend on the company. In fast organizations, 1 week is plausible, while in large enterprises it will likely be 2 weeks or more. Conversely, in smaller venture companies it might be 3 days. There's no single correct answer; the optimal value is simply determined by how the organization works. In large companies, communication and constraints are heavy, so it becomes slower at 2 weeks or more; in small, unconstrained companies, people can move tightly, so it may become shorter than 1 week. That's all there is to it. Use the unit sense that is actually used in your company.

Matching giggers with gigs works as follows.

- Prepare a platform that all employees can view
- Gigger:
    - Share their profile, track record, and current status
    - Share retrospective results for the gigs they handled
- Other employees:
    - Browse giggers and gigs
    - Define gigs (extract and publish work they want a gigger to do)
- Matching starts in either of the following ways:
    - A gigger applies to a gig
    - A gig definer requests a gigger
- Make matching as asynchronous as possible. At minimum, make it a lighter-weight process than normal hiring (including internal transfers)

The requirements for this role are as follows:

- **Be able to verbalize and promote your strengths and weaknesses**
- **Have no resistance to new work, and be able to proactively catch up, propose whether you can take it on, and discuss it without hesitation**
- **Be good at retrospectives**
    - Because they will conduct a retrospective for each gig and share the results

As a caution, gigs are operated openly. However, there is no need to disclose the personal information or confidential information of individuals on the project side that owns the gig. At minimum, it's enough if the content of the gig is understandable. Of course, it will be visible to all employees.

Also, since Alt PIP is not project work, a gigger's response will be best-effort. A finely managed approach that assumes onboarding is probably not suitable. Rather, it's more like: write a lot of context, what you want done, and constraints in text; hand it over; then leave it to them. Consultations are handled asynchronously on a regular basis or as needed. In other words, **the side defining gigs needs to be accustomed to asynchronous work**.

### Trickster
A trickster is a role that fully commits to breaking fixed ideas. They temporarily participate in some project, meeting, workshop, etc., and focus solely on proposing tricky ideas. Let's call this **trickstering**. A trickster is a dedicated trickstering specialist.

A trickster is like generative AI. Typically, the user provides input to the trickster, the trickster thinks through and outputs ideas, and the user reviews them and provides additional input if needed, repeating this cycle. Because the trickster focuses strictly on producing ideas, you treat them not as a project member but as a convenient tool.

Matching with a trickster is similar to a gigger: teams or individuals who want to break fixed ideas make requests to the trickster. Unlike giggers, there's no need to prepare a platform; setting up a contact point and doing some outward communication like a blogger is enough. The target is, of course, all employees, but if there is strong need, you can prioritize a particular cluster (e.g., allocating 70% of the work to trickstering with the executive layer).

Asynchronous work is recommended for tricksters, but if the trickster wants, synchronous is also fine. In matching, **the person who wants to break through should not say "adapt to our way of working"; instead, the trickster says "this is how I work; please use me effectively under that premise."** The trickster is a tool, and the way they work is also a constraint of the tool, so the user must follow it. Of course, if it's hard to use, the trickster must adjust how they are used, and receiving comments and engaging in discussion for that purpose is also one of their responsibilities.

The requirements for this role are as follows:

- **Have multiple weapons for breaking fixed ideas**:
    - Being neurodivergent
    - Being outside the company's standard values (e.g., in an organization where 90% of people in their 30s and above have been promoted at least once and are married, being "single and an individual contributor," etc.)
    - Being able to do creative thinking alone. For example, on an exploratory theme, spend 2 hours a day for a month, diverging into hundreds of sticky notes or snippets while also converging, and finally submitting a concise articulation of the essence
    - Having the skill to use generative AI to draw out diverse opinions, organize them under one's own judgment and responsibility, and submit them, etc.
- **Be able to thoroughly operate as a tool**:
    - Have the mental strength not to be harmed by being treated as a tool, or have a sustainable mechanism to vent in private
    - Be able to insist on being treated as a tool when people try to treat you as a project member instead

### Evangelist
Here, an evangelist refers to an **internal** evangelist. They take on one theme as a specialist or enthusiast and conduct two-way communication for all employees. Unlike a blogger, they don't focus only on publishing; they also run study sessions and events, set up an inquiry desk and answer on an ongoing basis, and so on. However, because it's Alt PIP, they do not do project work. **Therefore they do not bear responsibility or deadlines, and always operate on a best-effort basis.**

The requirement for this role is **having broad communication skills sufficient to cover two-way communication**. They must be able to create and operate diverse communication paths such as blogging, answering inquiries, hosting events, and 1-on-1s, and actually respond through them.

Another point is, of course, being able to hold one theme, but Alt PIP assignees will usually have at least one theme of some kind (and one that is beneficial to the company), and even if they don't, they can quickly become knowledgeable by picking something and studying it. It's not much of an issue. As listed in the requirements, broad communication skills are the biggest hurdle.
